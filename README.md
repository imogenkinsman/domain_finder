# Domain Finder

Say you're working on a new web project and suddenly think of a good name for it. "Well, this is sort of like Facebook, and also like Twitter," you muse. "I've got it - facetweet!"

You _could_ open up a browser tab and check domains on a registrar. Or, you could search _right in your terminal_ with Domain Finder.

## Installation

Easy peasy lemon squeezy:

    $ gem install domain_finder
